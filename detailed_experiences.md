| :----: | :-----: | :---------: | :----------------: | :-----: | :----------: |
| 2013 | Time series outlier detection and filling| Developed methods to detect outliers of time series data and fix them; Implemented into the new market data system for on-going detection/fix; Developed a GUI app to scan all time series quickly and apply the methods to historical data at the time|algorithm development and implementation, linear algebra; C#, Winform, SQL|fully hands-on, leading 2 team members | not applicable| 
| 2014 | SFT VaR | Developed a methodology to measure potential future exposures to repo-like products | market risk VaR, collateral/margin; Matlab| partially hands-on, guiding 1 team member | not applicable (internal use only)|
| 2015-2016 | FRTB - SA | External to the firm, I proactively contributed to the ISDA FRTB working group, in particular, on the standardised approach (SA); Provided feedbacks on early drafts of the BIS FRTB articles and proposed alternatives with other industry members; Represented the industry in meetings with regulators; Internally for the firm, implemented early versions of SA to participate the quantitative impact tests for the firm; Provided internal and external trainings; Spoke in conferences| regulatory advocacy, conference presentation, training; C#| fully hands-on leading 1 team members | not applicable |
| 2015-2016 | Credit VaR | Developed a new model for forecasting credit spreads (bonds, CDS, CDS indices) for both market risk and CVA VaRs. Addressed outstanding weaknesses of the existing model and helped the firm to retain the model permission (IMA) | systematic plus idiosyncratic, robust regression, cross-section method, curve fitting, PCA, time series construction, variance calculation, backtesting; C#, Matlab | fully hands-on, leading 2 team members | approved |
| 2016-2017 | ISDA SIMM | As a representative of the firm, contributed proactively to the industry-wide model development process and related activities through ISDA; Served as a member of the Executive SIMM committee; Produced a firm-specific methodology and implemented the SIMM; designed and executed a model management framework including backtesting; Represented the firm in the model approval process with the US Federal Reserve| industry engagement, risk sensitivities, reconciliation, variance calculations; C#| fully hands-on, leading 2 team members | approved |
|2018|Nelson Siegel|Applied the Nelson-Siegel parameterisation to enhance the interest rate simulation model for counterparty credit risk | optimisation, AR(1); Python | supervised a new junior member | post-notified |
| 2018-2019 | Sovereign Bond VaR |Developed a new VaR model for forecasting credit spreads of G11 sovereign bonds; Incorporated basis risks due to differences in bond types (conventional fixed, inflation-linked, strips, floaters) and ages (on-the-run, vantage); Remediate a material RNIV with large RWA saving| curve fitting using B-splines, robust regression, time series construction of bond curves from ISIN-level data, risky bond pricing model; C#, Python| fully hands-on, leading 1 team member | approved |
|2019| FRTB ES | wrote a firm-specific methodology of calculating expected shortfall (ES) under FRTB; Specified how to incorporate liquidity horizons and reduced set; Implemented calculation modules|interpreting regulations and applying to the firm's models;C#, Python | partially hands-on, guiding 1 team member | not applicable |
| 2021 | SOFR time series backfilling | As part of the risk-free-rate (RFR) transition project, we developed a method to backfill historical time series of new US swap curves on SOFR; Required for Stressed VaR calculations; Set up a monitoring framework | Exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) filtering, Regression, Curve building from deposit futures; Python| partially hands-on, guiding closely 1 team member | approved |
| 2021-TBD | Incremental Risk Charge (IRC) | Developed a new IRC model to remediate outstanding model weaknesses, seeking a new regulatory approval; The model could be configured easily to behave in a DRC mode, allowing the firm to prepare the FRTB IMA submission as well| Merton's framework to model migration and default events, multi-factor model for credit worthiness, parameter estimations using historical migration/default data, cross-section method, robust regression, robust correlation estimation, allocation, Monte Carlo simulation; Python| fully hands-on, leading 3 team members | preparing to submit to regulators |
| 2022 | RNIV automatisation | Automatised calculation of several material RNIVs to run daily from monthly| Python; Confluence; Scheduler| fully hands-on | not applicable |
